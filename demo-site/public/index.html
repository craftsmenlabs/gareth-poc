                <h3>Why</h3>

                <p>We think that while creating software we make, technically and from a business perspective,
                    assumptions on how the product will behave once in production. We also think that those assumptions
                    need to be verified.
                    And since we mostly build our products iterative, we need to be able to not only verify these
                    assumptions once but multiple times over a period of time.
                    &ldquo;Validate your assumptions automically and make them part of your development
                    proces&rdquo;</p>

                <h3>How</h3>

                <p>
                    &ldquo;By describing assumptions in a structured language, we can automatically validate if the
                    goals and assumptions that a product
                    owner made on forehand are really reached.&rdquo;

                <h3>What</h3>

                <p>
                    &ldquo;We want to create a DSL that product owners can use to describe their assumptions for a user
                    story. We
                    want
                    to
                    validate these described assumptions by adding gluecode and running these assumptions in a framework
                    that is
                    available next to your application in production.&rdquo;

                    <li  class="plus">The first round of validation is between the Product Owner, his or her stakeholders and is
                        administered in the backlog,
                        story maps and product canvasses.
                    </li>
                    <li class="plus">Validations in this round are: Is the vision of the product still right? Are the right persona’s
                        defined?
                        Is the impact of the software defined? Are the right activities defined? Are the goals clear?...
                    </li>
                    <li class="plus">The assumptions we make in this stage are things like: the performance of feature z will be 25%
                        better, feature y will decrease the usage of certain functionality by at least 50% over the next
                        3 months,
                        Feature x will be in our top 5 of highest value business transactions, after implementing
                        feature f the use of the contactform will decrease by 10 per week.
                        Don't worry! <strong>That’s where Gareth comes in.</strong> Just write the assumptions down in
                        easy readable human language.

                        These are the thing we think we can really benefit from. We are now able to decide to adjust the
                        feature or maybe completely remove it based on evidence.
                        We think that there is no shame in removing features that don’t give the resultswe where
                        expecting.

                <h4>Stories that don’t suck:</h4>

                <p>
                    Good story describes the goal a certain user wants to achieve with a piece of functionality (the
                    why). It should be pretty functional. It works very well to add acceptance criteria (BDD/ATDD
                    scenarios) in an early stage to fine-tune and make sure a functional validation is in place. Let’s
                    say that’s all in order.

                    We now want to introduce another dimension to make sure we achieve our goals. We add something we
                    called an experiment, which includes some assumptions, to an user story. These assumptions can be
                    measured and will be automatically validated.

                    Here is an example of a story we are using in our demo setup which contains both the BDD feature and
                    an experiment:
